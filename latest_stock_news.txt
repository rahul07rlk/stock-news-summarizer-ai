Infosys (NYSE: INFY) has announced a successful collaboration with LKQ Europe,
implementing a cloud-based digital Human Capital Management (HCM) platform
across 18 countries. The project leverages Infosys Cobalt to streamline HR
processes and enhance operational efficiency. The advanced analytics-enabled
platform, part of a five-year collaboration, aims to improve HR operations,
reduce costs, and boost productivity. It provides real-time insights into
employee engagement, retention, performance management, and workplace planning.
It ensures regulatory compliance and enhances employee experience through self-
service capabilities and streamlined workflows. The platform will unify LkQ
Europe's HR processes across locations, enabling faster delivery and better
service for end customers. It will foster a more cohesive organizational culture
in the automotive aftermarket industry. The five- year collaboration provides

capitalization. HR transformation projects typically generate strong margins
with potential for expansion into additional services over time. The automotive
after market sector expansion also indicates Infoios's continued industry

bonus shares, subject to requisite approvals. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is a FMCG
major and India's second-largest private sector employer after Tata Motors.

remain in focus today. The GIFT NIFTY futures were trading at 23,510, up 16.50
points, or 0.07%. This implies that the NifTY50 index will open 12 points lower.

Title     : RIL share price: 5 reasons why Reliance stock may outperform market - Business Today

Full Article Summary:
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has fallen over 20 per cent since July 2024 high.
Emkay Global sees a window of outperformance, driven by multiple positives. It
sees demand recovery for Reliance Retail in FY26, tariff hikes for telecom
business, and RIL turning free cash flow in FY 26 on moderating capex. The stock
performance is poised for an upswing amid underinvestment by mutual funds and
foreign investors, it said. The brokerage noted that a 10 per cent tariff hike
generally translates into a 15 per cent Ebitda surprise for the telecom business
and 6 per cent for the overall RIL. RIL's oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business may
face a challenging period over the next two years due to a weak cycle, which is
already accounted for in consensus estimates, the brokerage said. It also noted
that the RIL management attributed the soft FY25 for the retail business to
specific action on stores that was pending since the pandemic, though the
brokerage believes the generic demand slowdown also contributed. It added that
the stock trades at FCF yield of 1.8 per cent/2.9 per cent on FY26/FY27 after
four years of negative FCF. It noted that RIL trades near its five-year mean at
1.9 times P/BV, and a turn in FCF is a catalyst for a rerating.

Full Article Summary:
Reliance Industries share price declined over a per cent on NSE on Tuesday,
March 25, even as Indian stock market benchmarks ended with little gains. The
heavyweight stock has seen a healthy gain of about 7 per cent this month until
the closing of March 25th. This calendar year, the stock has gained 6 per cent,
while equity benchmark Nifty 50 has been flat for the same period. Reliance
share price has come under pressure along with several of its peers from the oil
and gas sector after US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that steep
tariffs will be imposed on imports from Venezuela. However experts say that
there is major negative for the Reliance stock at the current juncture and the
decline in the stock today could be because of profit booking as the company has
gained significantly this year, outperforming the equity benchmark. The Nifty
Oil & Gas index declined over 1 per cent during the session, with most stocks
suffering losses. The US tariff threat has raised concerns that it will
negatively impact the margins of major crude oil refiners such as Reliance
Industries. In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela in
2024. This was nearly 1.5 per cent of total crude oil purchases of the country.
The stock was 1.29 per cent down at ₹1,285.25 apiece on the NSE.

Full Article Summary:
Reliance Industries shares in focus as company halts Venezuelan crude purchases
after Trump's 25% tariff. India’s largest privately owned refiner is expected to
take delivery of a cargo of Merey crude currently en route from Venezuela.
Further purchases have been paused, according to people familiar with the
matter. The decision comes amid heightened scrutiny following Trump's executive
order, which takes effect on April 2 and targets any nation importing Venezuelan
oil with secondary tariffs. Reliance had secured U.S. waivers last year to
resume imports of Venezuelan crude, and data from Kpler estimates the company
has taken 6.5 million barrels since the beginning of the year. Other have
occasionally sourced Venezuelan crude from traders rather than directly from the
country, but Russian oil has remained a more attractive option due to its lower
cost and easier accessibility. The shares rose 2.1% in the past week. On the
technical front, the stock is trading above five of its eight key simple moving
averages but remains below its 5-day, 150-day and 200-day SMAs. The 14-day
Relative Strenstren is at its highest level in over a year. The stock has fallen
11.7% over the past year but gained 4.6% in a three-month period.
